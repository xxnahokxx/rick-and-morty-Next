        <p>The series follows the misadventures of alcoholic scientist Rick and his overly nervous grandson Morty, who split their time between domestic family life and intergalactic travel. Often finding themselves in a heap of trouble that more often than not created through their own actions, these two will get themselves out of trouble in the most entertaining way! This extremely clever show will blow your mind as well as all other parallel realities of your mind!</p>
